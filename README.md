## Overview  
This project analyzes the Amazon sales data to uncover the current trend in the market.  

## Tools Used  
- Power BI

## Insights  
1. Sales and Profit Trends
- Seasonality: The profit trend by month and year shows fluctuations, with noticeable peaks in April and slight dips around May. This suggests potential seasonal influences on sales performance.
- Overall Sales vs. Profit: Sales total $725.46K, while profit stands at $108.42K, indicating a profit margin of approximately 14.96%.
2. Profitability Analysis
- Profit vs. Sales Relationship: The scatter plot suggests that higher sales generally lead to positive profit margins, but there are instances of losses (negative profit margins) at lower sales levels. This could indicate that certain products or pricing strategies negatively impact profitability.
- State-wise Profit Distribution:
   -Top-Performing States: California and Washington generate the highest profits.
   - Loss-Making States: Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado show negative profits, meaning sales there may not be covering costs.
3. Category Performance
- The tree map suggests:
   -Binders, Phones, and Storage are the most sold items.
   -Tables and Bookcases appear in red, possibly indicating low profitability or loss-making products.
   -Paper and Furnishings have significant quantities sold, suggesting high demand.
